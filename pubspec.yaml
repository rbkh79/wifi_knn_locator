  # wifi_info_plus and wifi_scan are Android-only in this sample and
  # cause dependency resolution failures on some setups. They are removed
  # here so the app can be fetched and run on Windows for a UI preview.
  # Add them back when running on Android devices.
  # wifi_info_plus and wifi_scan removed for this debug build (UI + KNN demo).
  # Re-add them if you want real Wi‑Fi scanning on Android devices.
